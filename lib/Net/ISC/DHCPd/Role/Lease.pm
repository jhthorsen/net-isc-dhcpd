=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 atsfp

 $int = $self->atsfp;
 $self->atsfp($int);

The actual tsfp value sent from the peer. This value is forgotten when a
lease binding state change is made, to facillitate retransmission logic.

Actions: examine.

=cut

omapi_attr atsfp => (
    isa => Time,
    actions => [qw/examine/],
);

=head2 billing_class

 ?? = $self->billing_class;
 $self->billing_class(??);

if any (The class object is not currently supported).

Actions: none.

=cut

omapi_attr billing_class => (
    isa => 'Any',
);

 $str => $self->circuit_id;
 $self->circuit_id($str);

Circuit ID from Relay Agent Option 82.

=cut

omapi_attr circuit_id => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Str',
);

=head2 client_hostname

 $self->client_hostname($str);
 $str = $self->client_hostname;

The value the client sent in the host-name option.

Actions: examine, modify.

=cut

omapi_attr client_hostname => (
    isa => 'Str',
    actions => [qw/examine modify/],
);

=head2 cltt

 $int = $self->cltt;
 $self->cltt($int);

The time of the last transaction with the client on this lease.

Actions: examine.

=cut

=head2 dhcp_client_identifier

 $self->dhcp_client_identifier(??);
 ?? = $self->dhcp_client_identifier;

The client identifier that the client used when it acquired the lease.
Not all clients send client identifiers, so this may be empty.

Actions: examine, lookup, modify.

=cut

omapi_attr dhcp_client_identifier => (

    actions => [qw/examine lookup modify/],
);

=head2 ends

Setting this to "0" will effectively makes the DHCP server drop the lease.

Actions: examine, modify.

Note: This attribute can only be modified from ISC-DHCP-4.1.0.

=cut

omapi_attr ends => (
    isa => Time,

 $self->ip_address("22:33:aa:bb"); # hex
 $std_ip_str = $self->ip_address;

=head2 tsfp

 $self->tsfp($int);
 $int = $self->tsfp;

The adjusted time when the lease's current state ends, as understood by
