Revision history for Net-ISC-DHCPd

0.1702   Mon Jul 21 04:25:45 UTC 2014
       - fixing version format
       - changed bugtracker to github because it's easier to manage
       - added more tests for remove_<class>
       - bumped minimum perl version to 5.12.5.  That was the minimum version
         I could make the code run on.
       - removed children must be grouped in add_child to speed up parsing
       - changed parser to load child modules on demand (memory and speed
         improvements)
       - recursive includes (include files can include other files)
       - added speed test for larger DHCP files

0.17.1   Wed Jul 16 08:45:36 UTC 2014
       - Added support for the Failover Peer statement
       - Added Authoritative.pm module (fixes gh#4)
       - Fix type coercion in OMAPI module
       - support for range x.x.x.x;
       - Bumping minimum perl version to 5.12.5.  5.10.1 fails from getpos
         errors due to changes in the way filehandles work.  5.12.5 will be
         the version I test releases against.

0.17     Sun Jun  1 22:31:11 UTC 2014
       - Added make_immutable everywhere which greatly speeds up everything
       - fix to 00-load.t to remove old module and add new ones

0.16     Sun Jun  1 22:31:11 UTC 2014
       - Specifying minimum perl version of 5.8.3
         * Moose should require something similar so I don't think this will
         * break anyone.
       - [RT68736] Unit tests for pools
       - [RT60044] Conditional (if/then/else) support
       - [RT67742] Class support
       - [RT81382] Braces on the same line/weird formatting
       - [RT81269] OptionSpace does not require encapsulate
         * This breaks compatibility with old optionspace names
       - Support for named groups
       - Support for basic DHCPv6 commands
       - Subclass support
       - Added more child nodes to Include
       - Added zone statement
       - Whitespace changes in most regexes to allow non-standard configs
       - Multiline support for all commands
         * If a semicolon isn't found then a line will be concatenated until a
         * valid statement is found
       - method auto names are now based on $attr instead of $name
         * this affects things like find_classes, which used to be find_classs

0.10     Fri Jan  7 07:39:58 CET 2011
       - Fix (RT60044) partially fix for this ticket: OptionSpace can end
         without encapsulation.
         TODO: Conditions (if/elsif/else) are not yet supported
         Contributor: Nikolay A Petrov
       - Fix (RT64173) remove set() fom pod, since it does not exist

         Contributor: kornerr

0.09     Tue Aug 10 20:50:37 CEST 2010
       - Add find_foos() and remove_foos() methods for child Config objects
       - Add find_leases() method for child Lease objects
       - Add shared-network can have a name
       - Add Net::ISC::DHCPd::Role::Lease
       - Change max one "filename" per Host and Subnet object

         from the dhcpd3 binary, instead of the numeric exit value.
       - Change "leases" attribute has auto_deref
       - Improved documentation

0.0802   Tue Aug  3 08:23:56 CEST 2010

0.0801   Mon Aug  2 19:34:37 CEST 2010
       - Fix POD links: L<...>

0.08     Mon Aug  2 14:03:35 CEST 2010
       - Add (RT59816) support for "include ...;"
         generate() can either flatten includes or just print the
         "include" statement. parsing of includes is a manual
         operation.
         Contributor: napetrov
       - Add Function methods to manipulate body
       - Change filehandle is replaced with _filehandle
       - Change attributes holding a file is changed from Str
         to File (from MooseX::Types::Path::Class)

0.07     Fri Jun 18 01:30:15 CEST 2010
       - Add (RT58391) OMAPI lookup by hardware_address, even though
         it does not appear to described in the dhcpd manual (?)
         Contributor: Jeff Bair
       - Add (RT58391) post check after OMAPI read() to see if lookup
         attributes match retrieved data. This is because omapi/omshell
         seem to have a bug where lease lookup with "state" is ignored.
         This is subject for change!
         Contributor: Jeff Bair

       - Change OMAPI::Meta::Class is renamed to OMAPI::Sugar
       - Add (RT58391) t/20-omapi.t test which proves (?!) that state() is
         ignored by omapi/omshell.

0.05_02  Fri May 28 23:40:21 CEST 2010

         Contributor: Nito Martinez
       - Add types for coercion support
       - Can talk with the DHCP server, using omshell
        + stop remote server
        + read leases
        - write leases (should work)
        + read host
        - write hosts (should work)
